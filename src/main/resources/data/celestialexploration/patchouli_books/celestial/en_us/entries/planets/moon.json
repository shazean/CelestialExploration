      "text": "The moon's name, or rather, lack thereof, is because the moon was observed long before anyone realized that other moons existed, until Galileo Galilei discovered four moons (the Galilean moons) around Jupiter.  However, the word \"Lunar\" comes from the latin word \"Luna\", which, you guessed it, means \"moon\", and is used to describe anything moon-related."

      "text": "The moon has an atmosphere!  Well, kind of.  It's very thin and weak, so it doesn't protect from UV rays or meteorites or do any particularly interesting atmosphere-y things. Also interestingly enough, it's believed the moon may have once had a magnetic field, but now it's just as weak as its atmosphere."

However, as it orbits the Earth and the Earth orbits the sun, the sun does see all of the sides of the moon.  This means there is no \"dark side\" of the moonâ€¦ but there is a \"far side\"!"

      "text": "The surface of the moon is very cratered, due to the lack of atmosphere. In fact, one crater, Tycho Crater, is over 52 miles wide! All of these craters have left the moon covered in fine dust called \"reoglith\". Recently, in the last few decades, we've also confirmed that there is water on the moon, and even large amounts of ice water in the shadowy parts of the lunar poles."
